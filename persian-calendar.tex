% Sample modified for Persian Calendar. Note that the calendar package doesn't support Hijri calendar (AFAIK), therefore we have to use some hacks to have Persian months.
% The hack is as follows:
% Farvardin 1396 starts on Tuesday, so we shall find a month and a year that has 31 days and starts on Tuesday.
% Ordibehesht 1396 starts on Friday, so we shall find a month and a year that has 31 days and starts on Friday.
% Khordad 1396 starts on Monday, so we shall find a month and a year that has 31 days and starts on Monday.
% Tir 1396 starts on Thursday, so we shall find a month and a year that has 31 days and starts on Thursday.
% Mordad 1396 starts on Sunday, so we shall find a month and a year that has 31 days and starts on Sunday.
% Shahrivar 1396 starts on Wednesday, so we shall find a month and a year that has 31 days and starts on Wednesday.
% Mehr 1396 starts on Saturday, so we shall find a month and a year that has 30 days and starts on Saturday.
% Aban 1396 starts on Monday, so we shall find a month and a year that has 30 days and starts on Monday.
% Azar 1396 starts on Wednesday, so we shall find a month and a year that has 30 days and starts on Wednesday.
% Dey 1396 starts on Friday, so we shall find a month and a year that has 30 days and starts on Friday.
% Bahman 1396 starts on Sunday, so we shall find a month and a year that has 30 days and starts on Sunday.
% Esfand 1396 starts on Tuesday, so we shall find a month and a year that has 29 days and starts on Tuesday. This is pretty hard, since the only month with 29 days is February on leap years, do we have a leap year in which February starts on Tuesday? Let's find out!
% To find the months run `months-hack.py`.
% This is the output of that program:
% Farvardin ->      2013-01-01
% Ordibehesht ->    2016-01-01
% Khordad ->        2007-01-01
% Tir ->            2015-01-01
% Mordad ->         2012-01-01
% Shahrivar ->      2014-01-01
% Mehr ->           2006-04-01
% Aban ->           2013-04-01
% Azar ->           2015-04-01
% Dey ->            2016-04-01
% Bahman ->         2012-04-01
% Esfand ->         2000-02-01
